  My name is \myname{} \cred{}and \info{}.
  I have been working at this position for \tenure{}.

  I have known \studentfull{} for \studenttime{}.
  \student{} has demonstrated to me (in several environments) his extensive range of competency. He has an excellent grasp of very challenging and interdisciplinary material which draw from: computer science, electrical engineering, and physics.
  
  I worked with \student{} on several projects over nearly the past decade. In every case, \student{} demonstrated: leadership, outstanding quality of work, and a willingness to take on tasks with little instruction. I also enjoy following his work in sustainable construction and on-going professional development.
